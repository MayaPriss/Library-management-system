      <h3>Priya</h3>
      <p class="thanks">Thank you very much for the wonderful course and I really enjoyed it. I truly appreciate your time you spend helping me in my assignments.</p>
      <h3>Kenneth</h3>
      <p class="thanks">Hey Henry. Just wanted to say thanks for being a great teacher. Thanks for showing me that this career path isn't as daunting as I thought it would <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more3"> be. Thanks for answering all my questions, ridiculous or random as they have been (especially the 2-3 am ones). Though it hasn't been long, it feels like the end of a long journey (finally foundation is ending). 1 year feels like a decade thanks to covid... Yay I'm going to degree soon. Goddammit I'm going to degree soon... Whether I take CS or Software Engineering, they're both gonna be tough, but I'm sure even then your teachings and notes will still be useful by then. So yeah, just wanted to say. </span></p>
